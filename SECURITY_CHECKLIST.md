- [x] Database URL uses environment variables
- [x] Email credentials use environment variables
- [x] Google Sheets API credentials use environment variables
- [x] NextAuth secret is properly configured

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] NextAuth.js properly configured with secure secret
- [x] Password hashing using bcrypt
- [x] Session-based authentication
- [x] Protected routes with middleware
- [x] Admin role-based access control
- [x] Secure OAuth flow for Google authentication

### Data Protection
- [x] No SQL injection vectors (using Prisma ORM)
- [x] Input validation on forms
- [x] Secure password requirements
- [x] No sensitive data in console logs (production ready)
- [x] Proper error handling without information leakage

### Content Security
- [x] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- [x] No `eval()` usage
- [x] Controlled redirects only to trusted URLs
- [x] Input sanitization for user data

### Development/Debug Security
- [x] Debug console.log statements removed from production code
- [x] Debug API endpoints removed (`/api/products/debug`)
- [x] Error console.logs kept only for critical monitoring
- [x] No sensitive data logged to console

### API Security
- [x] Protected API routes with authentication checks
- [x] Proper error responses without sensitive data exposure
- [x] Rate limiting considerations (handled by Vercel)
- [x] CORS properly configured

### Email Security
- [x] Email templates sanitized (no XSS vectors)
- [x] SMTP credentials properly secured
- [x] Admin email addresses from environment variables
- [x] No email injection vulnerabilities

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Files Cleaned for Production:
- `src/lib/google-sheets.ts` - Removed debug logging
- `src/lib/notifications.ts` - Removed success logging that could leak info
- `src/app/api/products/route.ts` - Removed debug logging
- `src/app/api/products/debug/route.ts` - Removed entirely (security risk)

### Console Logs Remaining (Safe for Production):
- `src/contexts/CartContext.tsx` - Error handling for localStorage (safe)
- Error logging for email failures (necessary for monitoring)
- Error logging for Google Sheets API failures (necessary for monitoring)
- Error logging for database operations (necessary for monitoring)

### Environment Variables to Set on Vercel:
```
DATABASE_URL=<production-database-url>
NEXTAUTH_URL=<production-domain>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<secure-random-string>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<google-oauth-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<google-oauth-client-secret>
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL=<service-account-email>
GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY=<service-account-private-key>
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=<spreadsheet-id>
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=<smtp-host>
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=<smtp-port>
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=<smtp-username>
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=<smtp-password>
EMAIL_FROM=<from-email-address>
ADMIN_EMAIL=<admin-email-address>
```

## ✅ Ready for Production Deployment

The application has been thoroughly reviewed for security issues and is ready for deployment to Vercel. All debug logging has been removed and sensitive data is properly protected through environment variables.
