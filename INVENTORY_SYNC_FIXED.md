# ✅ INVENTORY SYNC ISSUE - RESOLVED

## 🔍 Problem Identified & Fixed

### **Issue**: Items removed from Google Sheets were still showing on the website

### **Root Causes Found**:
1. **5-minute cache** - Changes took up to 5 minutes to appear
2. **No deletion logic** - Products removed from sheets stayed in database forever  
3. **Foreign key constraints** - Couldn't delete products that had existing orders

## 🛠️ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Product Sync Logic** ✅
- **Before**: Only added/updated products, never removed them
- **After**: Properly handles removed products by setting quantity to 0
- **Benefits**: Maintains order history while hiding discontinued items

### 2. **Reduced Cache Time** ✅ 
- **Before**: 5-minute cache (300 seconds)
- **After**: 1-minute cache (60 seconds)
- **Benefits**: Changes appear much faster

### 3. **Added Manual Refresh** ✅
- **New Feature**: "🔄 Refresh Products" button in Admin Dashboard
- **Location**: `/admin` page (next to "Send Notifications")
- **Function**: Instantly clears cache and syncs with Google Sheets

### 4. **Smart Deletion Handling** ✅
